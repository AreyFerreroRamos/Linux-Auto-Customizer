- [x] Create a file and directory structure to add features to `.bashrc` without actually writing anything on it by using the wrapper in `.bash_functions`
- [x] Name refactor of functions to make it coincide with what command is being thrown in order to determine if it is installed using which
- [x] try refactoring the point above by using type, which recognizes alias and functions too
- [x] Add aliases to pycharm, clion, etc
- [x] Add argument to dummy commit
- [x] refactor installation bit to be installation order, which contains an integer that if it is greater than 0 means selected for install, and the integer determines the installation order

- [x] Replicate most of the necessary structures and data to adapt `uninstall.sh` to the new specs
- [x] Add special func in `uninstall` that uninstalls the file structures that the customizer creates (~/.bash_functions, ~/.bin, etc.) That cannot be removed directly using uninstall
- [x] Program function in `uninstall.sh` to remove bash functions
- [x] Program function to remove desktop icons from the bar's favorite in `uninstall.sh`
- [x] Program function to unregister default opening applications on `uninstall.sh`

- [x] Let uninstall run as normal user for the right features
- [x] Move all argument processing to the same data structure that we are using for storing info about the programs. This is in order to reduce the steps needed to implement a program an autogenerate a README.md table

- [x] Why some programs such as pycharm can not be added to favourites from the task bar? (related to launchers and how executables are related to launchers)
- [x] `install.sh`: Postman [link](https://gist.github.com/elcascarudo-dev/e39eacb490d11cea0c22e1923072d855)
- [x] `install.sh`: pgAdmin4 using pip and venv
- [x] `install.sh`: sonic-pi, jupyter-lab
- [x] `data_features.sh`: Implement more robustness in function change terminal-background. Change the use of `dconf` for `gsettings`, which is more safe, also make sure to have a correct value before changing background.  
- [x] `functions_common.sh`: (depends on merging installationtype with `common_data.sh` table). Create a function to autogenerate the `README.md` table from the `common_data.sh` table
- [x] `install.sh`: Force that the non-interactive running and the path is the first line in .bash_functions, as a common feature
- [x] `u` function needs a bit rework
- [x] `v` function for python3 virtual environments
- [x] `functions_install.sh`: Make download() and decompress() handle relative paths as paths from USR_BIN_FOLDER. if not absolute
- [x] `data_features.sh`: Add favorite function that works when being root --> Root programs in user's favorites bar write to `.profile` or `.bashrc` to set custom favorites bar. move add to favorites to `.bash_profile`
- [x] `install.sh`: Add debug mode, with a simple eval to inject code as a function
- [x] `commmon_functions.sh`: Implement execute_installation as a function that only uses as parameter the name of the program, in order to detect it's permissions and way of install for expanding the necessary data for that type of installation. With that, we will distinguish between a fully generic install or it will try to call an existent hardcoded function to install that feature
- [x] `README.md`: Refactor order of the table to follow the conventions on `install.sh`. (implement three sections)
