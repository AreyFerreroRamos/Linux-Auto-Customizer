- [x] `README.md`: Refactor order of the table to follow the conventions on `install.sh`. (implement three sections)
- [x] `functions_install.sh`: Extract creation of binaries to a common part of a generic install. Give extra logic to this functions to accept relative (from the created folder for the feature in USR_BIN_FOLDER) or absolute paths.

- [x] `install.sh`: Reload `bash` env at the end of install must not need to run bash command, instead use hash -r or similar strategy, also reload font cache
- [x] `data_features.sh`: ttf-mscorefonts-installer autoaccept end user agreement or goes out (may `yes | apt install ttf...` work?) --> Added frontend non interactive needs to be tested
- [x] `data_features.sh`: All features must be standarized to the default name and format of the variables for indirect expansion.
- [x] `data_features.sh`: in net-tools installation: alias ports="netstat -tulanp" # alias nr="net-restart"
- [x] `USR_BIN_FOLDER`: There should be no files in USR_BIN_FOLDER. features such as wallpapers, youtube-dl or cheat have to be moved
- [x] `data_features.sh`: Post installation Search for a new version of caffeine or do the modifications in the actual version, but do not apply a patch #  wget -O - https://gist.githubusercontent.com/syneart/aa8f2f27a103a7f1e1812329fa192e65/raw/caffeine-indicator.patch | patch /usr/bin/caffeine-indicator
